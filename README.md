## About
Introducing Bmazon, the reliable eCommerce store! We provide essentials at affordable prices for you. By playing our card game, you would gain more discounts on top of our affordable products. Bmazon is always at your service :)

## Design Process
As a user of this website, we want to use it to purchase essentials and play the card game in the website to earn more discounts. For instance, when I'm in the home page, I can read the brief about us, view featured products, and interact at the promotion section for their card game. The game page is where I can play the card game and the store page is where I can browse, and purchase essentials.
